# Neural-Network (single digit recognizer)
Making a neural network. 

## Overview of our project: 
we have two major files: main.c and nn.c   
There are other files which contains weights and biases which we import to our neural netowork through functions defined in nn.c


## nn.c
In this file we have described our nural structure and functions related to it like feedforward, getPrediction, networkInitialization, importing weigts and biases etc 

## main.c
This is our main entry point for our project, we have described our GUI (using raylib) here and also input processing is here too.
